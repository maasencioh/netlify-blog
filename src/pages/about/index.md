### Studies
I was admitted to study electronical engineering in the National University of Colombia in 2010, but I just found interesting to learn math, statistics and digital circuits, so I changed to study in Computer science in 2014 in the same university finishing my studies in 2017. While I was studying computer science, I discovered MOOCs and that was love a first sight! I could learn about interesting themes, like electronic models of neurons, machine learning, natural language processing, no-SQL databases, and develop in several languages and frameworks.

### Languages
First, as a Colombian citizen, my native language is Spanish, but for my studies, I have to learn English. I also had the opportunity to live in Lausanne, Switzerland, therefore I learn some French. Thanks to this journey I've found the interest to know more languages, so I'm learning Esperanto, Italian and plan to study German.
