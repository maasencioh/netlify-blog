  title: Who is this guy?
  description: >
      Hello world! I'm a Colombian developer that loves math, embedded systems, videogames, and other nerd stuff.

      I'm currently working on the data science team at "Resuelve tu deuda", I'm a full-time father and in my free time I write all the interesting things that I'm learning.
      
      If you want to know all the interesting tweets that I found interesting you can follow me on twitter, or you want me to show some code you can visit my profile on GitHub.
